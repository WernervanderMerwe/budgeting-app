# BudgetingApp

I am building a budgeting app based off an Excel Spreadsheet I made while finishing my studies to help me budget and make the most of my studying allowance.

I chose this "tech stack" because it is what I am using at work and would be a perfect opportunity to sink my teeth further into the nuances of angular, typescript classes, bootstrap and scss and other libraries we use that is relevant to this project.

I might release this when I figure out how to hide the data in a simple backend using express. Don't want all the users' money spending public ðŸ˜‚
